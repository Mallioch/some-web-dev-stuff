Hi. My name is [Eric Sowell](http://ericsowell.com) and I teach a front-end engineering course for [The Iron Yard in Dallas](https://www.theironyard.com/locations/dallas.html). In less fancy terms, I teach web development stuff to people who don&rsquo;t know a lot of web development stuff. If you are one of those people, I hope you find this useful.
